    <h3 class="h3-article2">Satire of sexualisation</h3>
    <div class="div-article2">
      <p class="p-article2">
        This month’s work is <strong>“Shirley Temple, The Youngest, Most Sacred Monster of the Cinema in Her Time”</strong>, which was made by <strong>Salvador Dali</strong>, the well known surrealist painter. Shirley Temple was a child actress in the mid-thirties. Dali took her head out of a newspaper and superimposed it to the body of a lioness, made to look like a sphinx. That’s why they sometimes call it “Barcelona Sphinx”. The idea behind this work is described as a satire on the sexualisation of child stars by Hollywood.
      </p>
      <p class="p-article2">
        <strong>Now it’s your turn</strong> to make a satire on sexualisation. You can start by <strong>downloading this painting</strong> to use as a template, or you can look through different submissions and use <strong>someone else’s submission as a template</strong>. Your only restriction is the size of your artwork should be the size of “Barcelona Sphinx” itself.

    <p>
      Every last friday of the month, we throw an <strong>afterwork party</strong> to close off the theme of the month. We’ll announce <strong>who’s work will be displayed</strong> in Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen when it re-opens, and <strong>announce next month’s theme and painting</strong>. You can sit back and relax, look at everybody’s submission from the last few weeks, or you can do a <strong>collaborative remake</strong> of the new painting.

  <p>
    Each month while Boijmans Van Beuningen is closed, we put one painting from our collection on display for you. There’s a <strong>theme linked to each month</strong>, and your job is to <strong>remake the painting</strong> in question with that theme in mind. You can also choose to work on <strong>someone else’s interpretation</strong> of the painting.
